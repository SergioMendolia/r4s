Killbox is 12 inches from the back edge as per the usual Steamroller document, however Killboxing yourself only gives your opponent 1 point instead of the regular 2. See the Steamroller Document for specifics regarding Killbox. A Warcaster or Warlock can control both overlapping zones if there are no models contesting them. A model can contest both zones if it is within both zones. Player 1 deploys at the 7 inch mark for regular deployment and 13 inch mark for advanced deploymentPlayer 2 deploys at the 10 inch mark for regular deployment and 16 inch mark for advanced deployment.",
